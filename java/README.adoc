== *JAVA 7*

== try-with-resources
Allows us to declare resources to be used in a _try_ block with assurance that the resources will be closed after the execution of the block. The resource must implement the _AutoClosable_ interface:

=== Syntax
The resource must be declared and initialized inside the _try_

[source, java]
----
try (PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new File("test.txt"))) {
	writer.println("Hello World!"):
}
----

=== _try-catch-finally -> try-with-resources_
.try-catch-finally
[source, java]
----
try {
	scanner = new Scanner(new File("test.txt"));
	while (scanner.hasNext()){
		//TODO
	}
} catch (FileNotFoundException ex) {
	ex.printStackTrace();
} finally {
	if (scanner != null) {
		scanner.close();
	}
}
----

.try-with-resources
[source, java]
----
try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File("test.txt"))) {
	while (scanner.hasNext()) {
		//TODO
	}
} catch (FileNotFoundException ex) {
	ex.printStackTrace();
}
----

===  With multiple resources
Multiple resources can be declared in a _try-with-resources_ block by separating them with a semicolon:
[source, java]
----
try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File("testRead.txt"))); //first resource
	PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new File("testWriter.txt")) { //second resource
	while (scanner.hasNext()) {
    	//TODO 
	}
}
----

=== A custom resource with _AutoCloseable_
The custom resource should implement the _Closeable_ or _AutoCloseable_ interfaces, and override the *_close_* method:
[source, java]
----
public class MyResource implements Autoclosable {
	
	@Override
	public void close() throws Exception {
		System.out.println("Closed MyResource");
	}
}
----

=== Closing Order
Resources that were defined/acquired first will be closed last(like a first-input/last-output):

*First Resource*
[source, java]
----
public class ResourceFirst implements AutoCloseable {
 
    public ResourceFirst() {
        System.out.println("Constructor -> Resource_First");
    }
 
    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("Something -> Resource_First");
    }
 
    @Override
    public void close() throws Exception {
        System.out.println("Closed Resource_First");
    }
}
----

*Second Resource*
[source, java]
----
public class ResourceSecond implements AutoCloseable {
 
    public ResourceSecond() {
        System.out.println("Constructor -> Resource_Second");
    }
 
    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("Something -> Resource_Second");
    }
 
    @Override
    public void close() throws Exception {
        System.out.println("Closed Resource_Second");
    }
}
----

*Order*
[source, java]
----
private void orderOfClosingResources() throws Exception {
    try (ResourceFirst first = new ResourceFirst();
        ResourceSecond second = new ResourceSecond()) {
 
        first.doSomething();
        second.doSomething();
    }
}
----

*_Result:_*
[source, java]
----
Constructor -> Resource_First
Constructor -> Resource_Second
Something -> Resource_First
Something -> Resource_Second
Closed Resource_Second
Closed Resource_First

== *JAVA 8*

=== Functional Programming
* Embraces creating immmutable objects
* More concise and reusable code
* Using functions/methods as first class citizens.
* Write code using DECLARATIVE APPROACH.

=== Imperative Style of programming
* Focuses on HOW TO perform the operations
* Embraces Object mutability
* This style of programming lists the step by step of instructions on how to achieve an objective
* We write the code on what needs to be done in each step.
* Imperative style is used with classic OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING.

=== Declarative style of programming
* Focuses on what is the result you want
* Embraces Object immutability.
* Analogous to SQL
* Use the functions that are already part of the library to achieve an objective.
* FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING uses the concept of declarative programming.

=== What is Lambda Expression?
* It's Equivalent to a function/method without a name.
* Also referred as Anonymous functions.
** Method parameters
** Method body
** Return type
* Lambdas are not tied to any class like regular method
* Can be assigned to a variable and passed around

Syntax:
  () -> { }

Usages of Lambda
* Mainly used to implement Functional Interfaces(SAM: Single Abstract Method)
* Annotation: @FunctionalInterface(Java 8)

=== Functional Interfaces
* Has exactly one abstract method.
* CONSUMER
* PREDICATE
* FUNCTION
* SUPPLIER

=== Method Reference
* Simplify the implementation of Functional Interfaces
* Shortcut for writing the Lambda Expressions.
* Refer a method in a class.

Syntax:
ClassName::instance-methodName
ClassName::static-methodName
Instance::methodName

Example
Using Lambda
Function<String, String> toUppeCaseLambda = (s) -> s.toUpperCase();

Using Method Reference
Function<String, String> toUppeCaseMethod = String::toUpperCase;

Constructor Reference
It can only be used in the context of Functional Interfaces.
Syntax
  Classname::new

Example
  Supplier<Student> studentSup = Student::new;
  //OK in the context of Functional Interfaces

  Student student = Student::new;
  //INCORRECT Not in the context of Functional Interfaces

=== Streams API
Stream is a sequence of elements.
* Main purpose is to perform some *Operation on Collections*
* Parallel Operations are easy to perform with Streams API withouth having to spawn a multiple threads.
* Can be used with Arrays or I/O.
* Stream Operations can be *sequentially* or *parallel*
* There 2 kind of operations: Intermidate Operations and Terminal Operation.


== *JAVA 9...12*

=== Why Modules?
.Old style
* Old classpath pround to error.
* Classpath is plain, can not express dependencies between components.
* Errors in runtime, hard to diagnose the problem

.New modules style
* Now modules declarations, 
* Contract between different components.
* This contract explicitly defines the relationship dependencies between modules.
* Any problem between configurations will discored at compile time.
* The contract espicify what the module exposes to the outside world on the package level

* Reliable configuration
* Strong Encapsulation
* Scalable Java platform, now is decompused into modules, this allow us custom configuration
* Greater platform integrity
* Improved performance

NOTE: Module Path does not replace classpath


==== *_Module declaration_*(_module-info.java_)
Describe how the module comunicates to the outside world, which modules expose, which modules requires

--class-path <classpath>
--module-path <modulepath>

The compiler verifies that all necessary modules are present


*Unamed module* is when there are not a module-info.java in the JAR
Everything in the classpath becomes _unamed module_
A *Named module* is a module declared in the module-info.java
A plain JAR with no module declarations becomes an *automatic module*
An _automatic module_ can be used as a dependency in other modules declarations

==== *Migrating to modules*
Is recommend to start migrating to Java module withouth especifying a module(automatic module) 
.Migrate without modules analyze with *jdeps*
* internal API
* Java EE modules
* internal Jars

.Migrate with modules
* jdeps --generate-module-info
* Strategies for modularization
** bottom-up
** top-down
** inside-out

If the application is a monolothic with a lot of dependencies between components it wold be beneficial to use modules.



TODO

why is immutability is important?
What are the benefits of stateless?
How to implement Sateless?
Favor composition over inheritance

=== Convert java project to maven
==== Add Maven supportï»¿ 
* Open an existing project, for example, a Java project. 
* In the Project tool window, right-click your project and select Add Framework Support. 
* In the dialog that opens, select Maven from the options on the left and click OK. ...
* Open the generated POM and specify a groupId .
