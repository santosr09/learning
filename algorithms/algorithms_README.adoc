=== BAGS
*Definition*
A collection where removing items is ot supported.

*Purpose*
Its purpose is to provide clients with the ability to collect items and then to iterate through the collected items.
The client can also test if a bag is empty and find its number of items.
The order of iteration is unspecified and should be immaterial to the client.


*Example*
public class Bag<Item> implements Iterable<Item>
Bag() //create an empty bag
void add(Item item)  //add an item
boolean isEmpty()  //is the bag empty?
int size()  //number of items in the bag
