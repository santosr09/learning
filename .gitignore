#For a better understanding of .gitignore, and directories and files: https://linuxize.com/post/gitignore-ignoring-files-in-git/

#The slash symbol (/) represents a directory separator. The slash at the beginning of a pattern is relative to the directory where the .gitignore resides.
#If the pattern starts with a slash, it matches files and directories only in the repository root.
#If the pattern doesnâ€™t start with a slash, it matches files and directories in any directory or subdirectory.
