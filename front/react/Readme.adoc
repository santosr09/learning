REACT

Imperative - Step by step, detailed instructions

Declarative(React): Component focused approach

React can be used to *control parts* of HTML pages or entire pages. *Widget* approach on a multi-page-application. (Some) pages are still *rendered on and server by a bakcend server*

React can also be used to *control the entire frontend* of a web application. Single-page-application(*SPA*) approach. Server *only sends one HTML page*, thereafter, React takes over and controls the UI.

React os Lean and focused component-based UI library.

Angular is complete component-based UI framework, packed with features. Uses TypeScript. Can be overkill for smaller projects.

JAVASCRIPT refresh

var <- previous ES6 | let and const <- new JS(ES6)
let: variable values
const: constant values

Example:
var myName = 'Max';
myName = 'new name';


Arrow functions

old JS
function myFunc() {
   ...
}

new JS(ES6)
const myFunc = () => { 
   ...
}


Exports and imports(Modules)

Spread and Rest Operators
...

_*Spread*_ Used to split up array elements OR object properties

const newArray = [...oldArray, 1, 2]
const newObject = { ...oldObject, newProp:5 }

_*Rest*_ Used to merge a list of function arguments into an array
function sortArgs(...args) { 
   return args.sort()
}


_*Destructuring*_ Easily extract array elements or object properties and store them in variables

Array Destructuring
[a,b] = ['Hello','Max']
console.log(a) //Hello
console.log(b) //Max

Object Destructuring
{name} = {name: 'Max', age:28}
console.log(name)//max
console.log(age) //undefined


Objects and arrays are reference types

React is all about components





I would like to be part of the Bitso team to collaborate on the growth of the company, I would like to work together with amazing people that are building and maintaining great software where every individual is high valorized and can produce a high impact on the final customers.

Although my experience could not fulfill 100% the requirements for the vacancy I'm sure that with my attitude, and my dedication I could (in a few months) be a great teammate.


I have no experience in applying functional programming to production code. However I understand the concept and I have worked with it in educational projects by using it in Java projects via Lambdas & Streams, and recently in React.
